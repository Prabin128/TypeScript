# TypeScript Student Grading Program

## Instructions:

Write a TypeScript program that performs the following tasks:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Declare and initialize variables to store a student‚Äôs marks in two subjects using the number type.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ Calculate the total marks obtained.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ Compute the average marks. 

4Ô∏è‚É£ Assign student name (string type). 

5Ô∏è‚É£ Determine the grade based on the average marks:
- If average marks ‚â• 80, assign grade "A".  
- Otherwise, assign grade "B". 
   
6Ô∏è‚É£ Check if the student has passed using a boolean value:
- A student is considered passed if average marks ‚â• 40 (boolean true), 
- otherwise false.

7Ô∏è‚É£Display the results using console.log(), including the student‚Äôs name, total marks, average marks, grade, and pass status.
